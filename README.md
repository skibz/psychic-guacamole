this repository just contains shell scripts to help get started building a löve2d game! have a squizz inside `/bin` and `main.lua` to get started!

note that the shell scripts included here are just for development and debugging. they aren't intended to be used as a formal release procedure. if you're looking for something along those lines, have a look at [MisterDa/love-release](https://github.com/MisterDA/love-release)!
